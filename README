*Description*

This is the CUDA miner extension (DLL + embeded code) for the Bitcoin Core https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git.
Under the hood minig threads are started for each CUDA compliant graphics
cards, and a hash is being guessed for each new block. The extension was
developed and tested for 0.21.0 version of Bitcoin Core. Not sure if it works
with new releases, it is not maintained any more.

Honestly, I did not managed to mine any single block because I am not lucky
to have powerful GPUs, and hashes are too complex now to guess them at home.
Only for the academical purpose this code can be used. But who knows, may be
You will be the lucky!

*Requirements*

- Microsoft Windows 10+
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019+
- Nvidia graphics cards with CUDA Cores (the more cards, the better)
- CUDA Toolkit X.Y (where X.Y last release). Download https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exe_local


*How to compile and run*

D:\> git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
D:\> cd bitcoin
D:\bitcoin> git checkout v0.21.0
# Configure MSVS and make sure that the project is compiled. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/build_msvc/README.md

# Apply patches (created by `git format-patch -3 HEAD')
D:\bitcoin> git apply --stat ..\libguess\v0.21.0\0001-Add-includeTransactions-parameter.patch
D:\bitcoin> git apply --stat ..\libguess\v0.21.0\0002-Add-libguess-project.patch
D:\bitcoin> git apply --stat ..\libguess\v0.21.0\0003-Embed-libguess-miner.patch
# Complile again

Create wallet and start bitcoind daemon (with the following extra options if necessary):

  coinbaseonly  Always create coinbase block (default false)
  disableminer  Disable CUDA miner at all (default false)
  testminer     Run the self-test before start the mining threads.(default false).

Check the debug.log to see the progress.
